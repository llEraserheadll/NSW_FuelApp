# ‚õΩ NSW Fuel Price Dashboard



Welcome to the **NSW FuelApp** ‚Äì a project built to fetch, clean, and visualize live fuel price data from New South Wales, Australia. This repository demonstrates a complete **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline in Python, with a simple dashboard for fuel price insights.

## üîÑ ETL Pipeline Breakdown

### 1. `NswAPI_call.py` ‚Äì **Extract**

This module connects to the official NSW Government Fuel API to retrieve real-time data about fuel stations and prices. It structures the data into a dictionary ready for ingestion.

### 2. `DB_Ingest.py` ‚Äì **Load**

- Reads the structured data from `NswAPI_call`.
- Creates two tables: `stations` and `prices` in a local `SQLite` database.
- Inserts or updates the records to ensure the latest data is maintained.

### 3. `Dataclean.py` ‚Äì **Transform**

- Fetches raw data from the SQLite DB.
- Standardizes station names and addresses.
- Fills in missing values and enforces consistent data types.
- Re-uploads the cleaned data back to the DB.

### 4. `Fueldashboard2.py` ‚Äì **Visualize**

- Creates an interactive dashboard using Dash/Plotly.
- Displays current fuel prices, price trends, and station locations.
- Helps analyze and compare fuel prices across regions and fuel types.
